git init
make a file named myfile.txt some lines
add and commit
check git log
make a new branch named new_branch
switch to the new branch
git status - nothing to commit
Add line added on new branch
add and commit on new branch
Again add third line and add and commit 
check git log
git switch master - 2 lines should disappear
git switch new_branch - 2 lines should come again

Now merge new_branch changes to master

git switch master
clear
git merge new_branch - should be a fast-forward merge

git branch - on master branch

Make another branch from master

git branch experimental 
git switch experimental
git status 
make a new file named experimental.txt and add a line
add and commit
switch back to master
create a new file named master.txt on master branch
add and commit
switch between master and experimental to understand the changes

Try merging experimental with master

git merge experimental - will be merged by ort strategy
no conflicts will be come, as same file mein conflicting changes nahi hai

Make a new branch from master bug_qa
git branch bug_qa
git branch - should be on master
Add a line on master in my file.txt
add and commit 
git switch bug_qa
add a different line on the same line where u added on master branch to make a conflicting change, so that we can see the case of merge conflicts
git status
add and commit
use git switch to check changes in master and bug_qa , you will realise the conflict
Come to master branch
git merge bug_qa
You will see the syntax highlight and markdown
Choose and resolve wisely and you will be able to merge
After making changes, do git commit
